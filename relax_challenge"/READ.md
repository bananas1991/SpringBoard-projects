Summary:
In the feature impotance analysis, we use inbuilt class feature_importances of the Logistic Regression. The results of the order of important features shows that opted_in_to_mailing_list has the biggest importance, after that history	and org_id.

Insights:

We can clearly see that users who opted in to mailing list are most likely to become adopted user, so going forward plan should be for all new users to be encouraged to opt in for that options.
We should also push on enabling for marketing drip, we can see that has a big importance on becoming adopted user.
And for all different creation_sources it seems that ORganazation INVITE has the biggest importance.
